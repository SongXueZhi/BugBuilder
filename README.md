**What does BugBuilder do?**

BugBuilder is a tool to extract complete and concise bug-fixing patches from human-written patches in version control systems. 

**How to obtain BugBuilder?**

The replication package, including BugBuilder itself, can be downloaded from https://github.com/jiangyanjie/BugBuilder (This repository is permanently stored and publicly available).

**What does the replication package contain?**

There are several folders within the replication package:

**/Implementation:** The source code of BugBuilder (Java).

**/EvaluationData:** The patches generated by BugBuilder in the evaluation as well as their explanations.

**/EvaluationData/matchedPatches:** Patches generated by BugBuilder that are identical to those in Defects4J

**/EvaluationData/mismatchedAndUnconcisePatches:** Unconcise patches generated by BugBuilder

**/EvaluationData/mismatchedButConcisePatches:** Concise patches generated by BugBuilder that are different from those in Defects4J, and the justification/explanation for the conciseness (presented as README files accompanying the patches).
